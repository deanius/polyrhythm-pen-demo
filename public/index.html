      In contrast with a full web browser, when you're working with IOT, you
      often have only a single button the user must funnel all of their
      interactions through. Stephen Hawking's award winning speech synthesis
      device had only one button!
      <br />
      Here, we introduce a simulation of a single-button device.
      <br />
      Play with the device above, following the instructions, to get a feel for
      how this device operates. Can you get it to behave strangely, or is it
      behaving as specified below?

      <br />
      The button:

      <ol>
        <li>
          Is a momentary-press type which will default to UP, while also capable
          of being DOWN.
        </li>
        <li>
          Must recieve 5 press/release within 1500 msec to trigger the device to
          turn on.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the device is on, holding the button DOWN will trigger the LED
          and the coil to turn on.
        </li>
        <li>Once the button is back UP, the coil and LED will turn off.</li>
        <li>
          Button presses have no effect while the device is off (except the
          5-press).
        </li>
        <li>
          When transitioning between on/off states, the device will blink 5x to
          give the user some time to see the effect of the change.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />

      <br />
      For the safety of the user, the heating coil:
      <ol>
        <li>Must never be on before the device has been turned on</li>
        <li>Must initially be turned off</li>
        <li>Must light an LED while it is on</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      Think about how you would approach this problem. How would you make sure
      that if someone clicks 6 times in a row, not 5, that the 6th click does
      not toggle the device state again (how would you <i>quiesce</i> the
      stream?). This kind of code is just poetry, with
      <a href="http://reactivex.io/">RxJS</a>, in my opinion.
